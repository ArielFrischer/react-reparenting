## What does it do? ðŸ¤¨

Imagine that you have two Parent components, both with some Child components. To `transfer` a Child from one Parent to another, the components must be `re-rendered` with that Child in its new Parent. This procedure has obvious usability and performance `limits`, the transferred component is disassembled, reassembled and loses its internal state, as well as all the nodes it has generated (such as a `<div>`).

React does not offer specific APIs to solve this problem, in many cases we try to deal with the problem using `Portals` and `refs`. This approach presents other problems, it is difficult to implement for large-scale apps and above all it does not give the feeling of being very `"Reactive"`. In fact, the portals have been designed to solve other problems, citing the documentation:

> Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

This process is more related to the DOM (Making the approach limited to ReactDOM), at `"React level"` the Child is still part of the same Parent. This is where `React-reparenting` intervenes.

This package offers `easy` and `intuitive` tools to solve this problem. With a few lines of code you will be able to re-render your app and transfer your children, without being reassembled or losing their internal state.
